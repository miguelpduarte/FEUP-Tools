# FEUP-Tools
Tools for scraping FEUP (and also potentially UP)'s data via web scraping and API requests.

This repo was created since several things were laying around from personal projects, [tts-fe](https://github.com/NIAEFEUP/tts-fe), [uporto-timetable-scraper](https://github.com/NIAEFEUP/uporto-timetable-scraper), etc. and I didn't want to lose them.

This might also be a good place for other folks to "steal" this work and use them for themselves.
